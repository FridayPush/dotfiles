# dotfiles
Quick setup for an OSX dev environment. Usage:
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simpsonjon/dotfiles/master/startup.sh)
```

Todo: initialize and configure Docker and create a base VM. Also figure out a way to symlink configuration files that are currently hosted on dropbox for file sync.
